Configuration: Symetrical
Astroid Fields: Yes
Nebulae: Yes
Wormholes: No

Info: This is a vertically oriented map which there are few and far between to begin with. As regards to the moon quantity, its 22 dil and 16 tri. I mostly wanted to try out a concept where there would be nebulae involved in key areas of the field. But I figured that for sake of tactics I could not put nebulae everywhere because it'd cause to much lag. So the guys in the corner get a makeshift fortress with Tetryons in one entrance and Mutara in the other. Good luck trying to find your enemies in the big cloud masses.
